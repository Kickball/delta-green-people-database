## Custom Databases

The `people.json` file in the main directory is a fairly generic database of Impossible Landscapes data (up to Night Floors currently).

The `my-game.json` file in this directory is a copy of the database for the Impossible Landscapes campaign I'm currently running -- which, due to the actions of the agents, has some customisations (integrating my agents families into the history of the campaign, tweaking/introducing characters based on what they do)
